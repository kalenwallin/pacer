/**
 * A low-level Solid hook that creates an `AsyncRateLimiter` instance to limit how many times an async function can execute within a time window.
 *
 * This hook is designed to be flexible and state-management agnostic - it simply returns a rate limiter instance that
 * you can integrate with any state management solution (createSignal, etc).
 *
 * Rate limiting is a simple approach that allows a function to execute up to a limit within a time window,
 * then blocks all subsequent calls until the window passes. This can lead to "bursty" behavior where
 * all executions happen immediately, followed by a complete block.
 *
 * The rate limiter supports two types of windows:
 * - 'fixed': A strict window that resets after the window period. All executions within the window count
 *   towards the limit, and the window resets completely after the period.
 * - 'sliding': A rolling window that allows executions as old ones expire. This provides a more
 *   consistent rate of execution over time.
 *
 * Unlike the non-async RateLimiter, this async version supports returning values from the rate-limited function,
 * making it ideal for API calls and other async operations where you want the result of the `maybeExecute` call
 * instead of setting the result on a state variable from within the rate-limited function.
 *
 * For smoother execution patterns, consider using:
 * - Throttling: Ensures consistent spacing between executions (e.g. max once per 200ms)
 * - Debouncing: Waits for a pause in calls before executing (e.g. after 500ms of no calls)
 *
 * Rate limiting is best used for hard API limits or resource constraints. For UI updates or
 * smoothing out frequent events, throttling or debouncing usually provide better user experience.
 *
 * Error Handling:
 * - If an `onError` handler is provided, it will be called with the error and rate limiter instance
 * - If `throwOnError` is true (default when no onError handler is provided), the error will be thrown
 * - If `throwOnError` is false (default when onError handler is provided), the error will be swallowed
 * - Both onError and throwOnError can be used together - the handler will be called before any error is thrown
 * - The error state can be checked using the underlying AsyncRateLimiter instance
 * - Rate limit rejections (when limit is exceeded) are handled separately from execution errors via the `onReject` handler
 *
 * ## State Management and Selector
 *
 * The hook uses TanStack Store for reactive state management. The `selector` parameter allows you
 * to specify which state changes will trigger a re-render, optimizing performance by preventing
 * unnecessary re-renders when irrelevant state changes occur.
 *
 * **By default, there will be no reactive state subscriptions** and you must opt-in to state
 * tracking by providing a selector function. This prevents unnecessary re-renders and gives you
 * full control over when your component updates. Only when you provide a selector will the
 * component re-render when the selected state values change.
 *
 * Available state properties:
 * - `currentWindowStart`: Timestamp when the current window started
 * - `executionCount`: Number of function executions that have been completed
 * - `hasError`: Whether the last execution resulted in an error
 * - `isExecuting`: Whether an async function execution is currently in progress
 * - `lastError`: The error from the most recent failed execution (if any)
 * - `lastResult`: The result from the most recent successful execution
 * - `nextWindowTime`: Timestamp when the next window begins
 * - `rejectionCount`: Number of function calls that were rejected due to rate limiting
 * - `remainingInWindow`: Number of executions remaining in the current window
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * // Default behavior - no reactive state subscriptions
 * const { maybeExecute } = createAsyncRateLimiter(
 *   async (id: string) => {
 *     const data = await api.fetchData(id);
 *     return data; // Return value is preserved
 *   },
 *   { limit: 5, window: 1000 } // 5 calls per second
 * );
 *
 * // Opt-in to re-render when rate limit and execution state changes (optimized for UI feedback)
 * const rateLimiter = createAsyncRateLimiter(
 *   async (query) => {
 *     const result = await searchAPI(query);
 *     return result;
 *   },
 *   { limit: 10, window: 60000 },
 *   (state) => ({
 *     remainingInWindow: state.remainingInWindow,
 *     isExecuting: state.isExecuting,
 *     rejectionCount: state.rejectionCount
 *   })
 * );
 *
 * // Opt-in to re-render when error state changes (optimized for error handling)
 * const rateLimiter = createAsyncRateLimiter(
 *   async (query) => {
 *     const result = await searchAPI(query);
 *     return result;
 *   },
 *   {
 *     limit: 10,
 *     window: 60000, // 10 calls per minute
 *     onReject: (info) => console.log(`Rate limit exceeded: ${info.nextValidTime - Date.now()}ms until next window`)
 *   },
 *   (state) => ({ hasError: state.hasError, lastError: state.lastError })
 * );
 *
 * // Access the selected state (will be empty object {} unless selector provided)
 * const { remainingInWindow, isExecuting } = rateLimiter.state();
 * ```
