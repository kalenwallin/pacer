/**
 * A low-level React hook that creates an `AsyncRateLimiter` instance to limit how many times an async function can execute within a time window.
 *
 * This hook is designed to be flexible and state-management agnostic - it simply returns a rate limiter instance that
 * you can integrate with any state management solution (useState, Redux, Zustand, Jotai, etc).
 *
 * Rate limiting allows an async function to execute up to a specified limit within a time window,
 * then blocks subsequent calls until the window passes. This is useful for respecting API rate limits,
 * managing resource constraints, or controlling bursts of async operations.
 *
 * Unlike the non-async RateLimiter, this async version supports returning values from the rate-limited function,
 * making it ideal for API calls and other async operations where you want the result of the `maybeExecute` call
 * instead of setting the result on a state variable from within the rate-limited function.
 *
 * The rate limiter supports two types of windows:
 * - 'fixed': A strict window that resets after the window period. All executions within the window count
 *   towards the limit, and the window resets completely after the period.
 * - 'sliding': A rolling window that allows executions as old ones expire. This provides a more
 *   consistent rate of execution over time.
 *
 * Error Handling:
 * - If an `onError` handler is provided, it will be called with the error and rate limiter instance
 * - If `throwOnError` is true (default when no onError handler is provided), the error will be thrown
 * - If `throwOnError` is false (default when onError handler is provided), the error will be swallowed
 * - Both onError and throwOnError can be used together - the handler will be called before any error is thrown
 * - The error state can be checked using the underlying AsyncRateLimiter instance
 * - Rate limit rejections (when limit is exceeded) are handled separately from execution errors via the `onReject` handler
 *
 * ## State Management and Selector
 *
 * The hook uses TanStack Store for reactive state management. The `selector` parameter allows you
 * to specify which state changes will trigger a re-render, optimizing performance by preventing
 * unnecessary re-renders when irrelevant state changes occur.
 *
 * **By default, there will be no reactive state subscriptions** and you must opt-in to state
 * tracking by providing a selector function. This prevents unnecessary re-renders and gives you
 * full control over when your component updates. Only when you provide a selector will the
 * component re-render when the selected state values change.
 *
 * Available state properties:
 * - `errorCount`: Number of function executions that have resulted in errors
 * - `executionTimes`: Array of timestamps when executions occurred for rate limiting calculations
 * - `isExecuting`: Whether the rate-limited function is currently executing asynchronously
 * - `lastResult`: The result from the most recent successful function execution
 * - `rejectionCount`: Number of function executions that have been rejected due to rate limiting
 * - `settleCount`: Number of function executions that have completed (success or error)
 * - `successCount`: Number of function executions that have completed successfully
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * // Default behavior - no reactive state subscriptions
 * const asyncRateLimiter = useAsyncRateLimiter(
 *   async (id: string) => {
 *     const data = await api.fetchData(id);
 *     return data; // Return value is preserved
 *   },
 *   { limit: 5, window: 1000 } // 5 calls per second
 * );
 *
 * // Opt-in to re-render when execution state changes (optimized for loading indicators)
 * const asyncRateLimiter = useAsyncRateLimiter(
 *   async (id: string) => {
 *     const data = await api.fetchData(id);
 *     return data;
 *   },
 *   { limit: 5, window: 1000 },
 *   (state) => ({ isExecuting: state.isExecuting })
 * );
 *
 * // Opt-in to re-render when results are available (optimized for data display)
 * const asyncRateLimiter = useAsyncRateLimiter(
 *   async (id: string) => {
 *     const data = await api.fetchData(id);
 *     return data;
 *   },
 *   { limit: 5, window: 1000 },
 *   (state) => ({
 *     lastResult: state.lastResult,
 *     successCount: state.successCount
 *   })
 * );
 *
 * // Opt-in to re-render when error/rejection state changes (optimized for error handling)
 * const asyncRateLimiter = useAsyncRateLimiter(
 *   async (id: string) => {
 *     const data = await api.fetchData(id);
 *     return data;
 *   },
 *   {
 *     limit: 5,
 *     window: 1000,
 *     onError: (error) => console.error('API call failed:', error),
 *     onReject: (rateLimiter) => console.log('Rate limit exceeded')
 *   },
 *   (state) => ({
 *     errorCount: state.errorCount,
 *     rejectionCount: state.rejectionCount
 *   })
 * );
 *
 * // Opt-in to re-render when execution metrics change (optimized for stats display)
 * const asyncRateLimiter = useAsyncRateLimiter(
 *   async (id: string) => {
 *     const data = await api.fetchData(id);
 *     return data;
 *   },
 *   { limit: 5, window: 1000 },
 *   (state) => ({
 *     successCount: state.successCount,
 *     errorCount: state.errorCount,
 *     settleCount: state.settleCount,
 *     rejectionCount: state.rejectionCount
 *   })
 * );
 *
 * // Opt-in to re-render when execution times change (optimized for window calculations)
 * const asyncRateLimiter = useAsyncRateLimiter(
 *   async (id: string) => {
 *     const data = await api.fetchData(id);
 *     return data;
 *   },
 *   { limit: 5, window: 1000 },
 *   (state) => ({ executionTimes: state.executionTimes })
 * );
 *
 * // With state management and return value
 * const [data, setData] = useState(null);
 * const { maybeExecute, state } = useAsyncRateLimiter(
 *   async (query) => {
 *     const result = await searchAPI(query);
